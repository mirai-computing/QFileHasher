	About

QFileHasher is an application to calculate and verify checksums (hashes) of 
multiple files with wizard-like GUI. It supports 12 hashing algorithms: CRC32,
MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA2 (224,256,384,512)-bit, RIPEMD (128,160,256,320)-bit,
Whirlpool, ED2K, AICH, Tiger, TTH. Taking into account modifications of SHA2 
and RIPEMD total number of supported algorithms is 18. Also, QFileHasher 
supports a number encodings for text representation of checksums: Base16 
(hexadecimal), Base32, Base32hex, Base64, Base64url. 

QFileHasher allows processing of nested directories and provides a number of 
ways to update existing checksum files: Brief, Deep, Complete, delta-Deep and
delta-Complete. Difference between updating modes is described by following
matrix:

Search for new files:              Deep, Complete, delta-Deep, delta-Complete
Search for new directories:              Complete,             delta-Complete
Process listed files:       Brief, Deep, Complete,
Process only new files:                            delta-Deep, delta-Complete

All files assumed to be UTF-8 encoded by default, but support for 8-bit
encondings is also included.

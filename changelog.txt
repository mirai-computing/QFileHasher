--- FUTURE : 1.0 release ---
--- 05mar10 : 1.0beta3update1 ---
[!] Fixed bug causing crash while trying to verify an SFV file.
[!] Fixed few ugly bugs that almost rendered unusable hash encoding support.
[+] Modified checksum file update modes to work closer to how they should.
--- 30jan10 : 1.0beta3 ---
[+] CFileHasher is heavily rewritten to comply with new architecture, more open
    for features and less error-prone. However, still requires some effort.
[+] Added HTML report page (hashing table in HTML format) and file lists for
    groups of files (all, good - processed without errors, broken - processed
    with any error, files with hash mismatch, files with access errors).
    Any of these lists can be saved to a plain text file.
[*] The list of files selected for hashing is now cleared by default
    (previously it was kept from an earlier action).
[+] Added "Refresh" button to the root directory selection page and to the
    file selection page.
[+] Selected files now can be deselected individually with a double-click.
[+] Optional header, hash algorithm, comment characters, date and time format,
    hash encoding.
[+] Added differential update modes delta-Deep and delta-Complete
[+] New CByteArrayCodec class for encoding and decoding data with Base16,
    Base32, Base32hex, Base64 and Base64url encodings. Some hases are usually
    stored BaseN-encoded, where N is >=32.
[+] Added hash representation controls to checksum file preview screen.
[+] A more accurate file size presentation.
[+] Added support for different file encodings, automatic checksum file
    reloading and positioning in browser on encoding selection changes.
[+] Added a new button to restart hashing.
[*] Added new settings page for fine application tuning.
[+] Logo icons for all standard sizes: original SVG,
    16,24,32,48,64,128,256,512-pixel PNGs,
    16,24,32,48,64,128-pixel 8-bit/trasparent Windows ICOs.
[!] Fixed minor flaw in hashing thread potentially leading to misbehaviour.
--- 17oct09 : 1.0beta2update2 ---
[+] Added support for new hashing algorithms using "librhash" library,
    now 4 algorithms more are available: CRC32, ED2K, AICH, TTH.
[+] Added support for SHA2 algorithm (224,256,384 in 512-bit versions),
    RIPEMD (128,160,256,320-bit versions), Tiger and Whirlpool
    using parts of "libtomcrypt" library. A lot of thanks to Tom St Denis. :)
    Total number of suppoted hashes is now 12 (18 including SHA2/RIPEMD mods).
[*] Checksum file parsing routines rewritten from a scratch for better
    compatibility with 3rd party applications.
[+] Added initial support for SFV files.
[!] Fixed file numbering issue: file counter  the status bar now shows correct file numbers.
[!] Fixed inaccessible files issue: different path separators might got mixed
    if a checksum file was transferred between different systems, such paths
    sometime make listed files virtually unreachable. System functions were
    found helpless against mixed paths, some preconditioning was necessary.
--- internal changes ---
[+] New class CCryptographicHash acts as a proxy between various implementations
    of hashing algorithms and reimplements built-in class QCryptographicHash
    to support greater number of them and provide algorithm information.
[-] CHashInfo class is removed, its functions are replaced by CCryptographicHash
--- 07oct09 : 1.0beta2update1 ---
[+] qfilehasher.rc included in src package.
[*] Root directory path is now updated when switching to verification mode.
[!] Regression fixed: new action could not be started if previous one has been
    stopped while processing was paused.
